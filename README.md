# Heart-Beat-Data-Aquisition-System

The Heart Beat Data Acquisition system starts and stops with a physical momentary push button. The input of the data acquisition system is the heartbeat sensor or function generator which is used as the transducer component. The ESDX microcontroller is programmed to take the input of the analog signal and convert the signal to a digital conversion that is then serially communicated to the computer using MATLAB to display the BPM signal. The ESDX microcontroller is also programmed to convert the BPM to LEDs using a binary-coded decimal representation.
